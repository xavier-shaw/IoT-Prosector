IoTProsector: Reasoning about the Internal States of Blackbox IoT Devices Using Side-Channel Information

IoTProsector is an interactive system designed to help users form mental models of black-box IoT devices. It consists of two key components: (i) a multi-modal sensing technique that combines power consumption, network traffic, and radio emanations; (ii) an annotation interface with interactive visualizations, enabling users to construct and refine these mental models as finite state machines.

## Installation

```
"node": "v21.2.0"
"npm": "10.2.3"
"python": "3.10.13"
